# BPMN Based Ontology (BBO)

The core element of BBO is a fragment of BPMN 2.0 including concepts, relations an attributes to describe business processes (mainly Chapter 10 of BPMN 2.0 specification). We enriched this fragment with taxonomies, new concepts and relations to have a fine grained representation of business processes.


## competency questions
The file named "Competency questions.docx" contains the main competency questions that we collected from industrial companies and literature. 

## Specification in natural language
BPMN 2.0 specification contains many restrictions in natural language. The file "OWL axioms from natural language specifications.docx" contains the list of BPMN 2.0 specifications in natural language that we manually formalized in OWL. This list is not exhaustive and we are working to formalize the maximum number of specifications.
